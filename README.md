##  Cybersecurity Focus

> OBD-II interfaces â€” especially wireless adapters â€” can be vulnerable.

**Risks Identified:**
- No encryption/authentication in some devices  
- Remote ECU access  
- CAN-bus injection or data manipulation  
- Unauthenticated DTC clearing

**Mitigation Tips:**
- Use adapters with security (PIN-code or encrypted)  
- Avoid leaving OBD devices plugged in permanently  
- Consider IDS solutions for CAN-bus monitoring (advanced users)
